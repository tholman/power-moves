## Some good lines to use
- "I'm at 5%, you'll have to be quick"
- "Down to 3%, make it snappy."
- "At 2%, speak fast or forever hold your peace."
- "4% left, words are a luxury I can’t afford."
- "I’ve got 1%, so this better be good."
- "2% left, the race against time is real."
- "4% here, let’s treat this like an elevator pitch."
- "I’m at 3%, say it like you mean it."
